We select the commit, fix, merge operations and other data of each author in the Linux library as indicators, use Python to automatically capture and count them, 
and then use these indicators to give each author an index to measure their contribution to the Linux library through modeling. Then, the authors are grouped according to their time zone, 
and their contribution index is summed to get the sum of the contributions of engineers to Linux Library in each time zone.

The main continents of the world are divided into two parts: the United States to the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean and Europe to the east coast of Eurasia. 
In these two parts, the contribution of engineers to Linux library gradually decreases from west to East. The decreasing trend from the United States to the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean is obvious, 
and the correlation coefficient is - 0.71. The decreasing trend from Europe to the east coast of Eurasia is not obvious, and the correlation coefficient is - 0.58.
