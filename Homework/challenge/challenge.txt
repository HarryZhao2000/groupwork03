challenge1:
    pd.concat([df, df['hour'] - df['hour'].shift(1).fillna(0)], axis=1)
challenge2:
	challenge.py file is the code.
	We choose the histogram with 10 bins based on 3 indicators:
	Number of groups with frequency 0: If there are too many empty groups, it is a waste of bins, which means we do not need that many bins.
	The standard deviation of the frequency difference between adjacent groups: The more the standard deviation is, the more likely this histogram is impacted by the boundary value, which lies on the dividing line between bins.
	The standard deviation of the difference between the frequency and the average frequency: The more the standard deviation is, the more likely that there are some bins have not been divided enough. Those bins with high frequency need to be divided further.
