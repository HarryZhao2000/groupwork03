    iommu/vt-d: Populate debugfs if IOMMUs are detected
    
    Currently, the intel iommu debugfs directory(/sys/kernel/debug/iommu/intel)
    gets populated only when DMA remapping is enabled (dmar_disabled = 0)
    irrespective of whether interrupt remapping is enabled or not.
    
    Instead, populate the intel iommu debugfs directory if any IOMMUs are
    detected.

    KVM: x86: Initializing all kvm_lapic_irq fields in ioapic_write_indirect
    
    Previously all fields of structure kvm_lapic_irq were not initialized
    before it was passed to kvm_bitmap_or_dest_vcpus(). Which will cause
    an issue when any of those fields are used for processing a request.
    For example not initializing the msi_redir_hint field before passing
    to the kvm_bitmap_or_dest_vcpus(), may lead to a misbehavior of
    kvm_apic_map_get_dest_lapic(). This will specifically happen when the
    kvm_lowest_prio_delivery() returns TRUE due to a non-zero garbage
    value of msi_redir_hint, which should not happen as the request belongs
    to APIC fixed delivery mode and we do not want to deliver the
    interrupt only to the lowest priority candidate.
    
    This patch initializes all the fields of kvm_lapic_irq based on the
    values of ioapic redirect_entry object before passing it on to
    kvm_bitmap_or_dest_vcpus().

    KVM: VMX: Condition ENCLS-exiting enabling on CPU support for SGX1
    
    Enable ENCLS-exiting (and thus set vmcs.ENCLS_EXITING_BITMAP) only if
    the CPU supports SGX1.  Per Intel's SDM, all ENCLS leafs #UD if SGX1
    is not supported[*], i.e. intercepting ENCLS to inject a #UD is
    unnecessary.
    
    Avoiding ENCLS-exiting even when it is reported as supported by the CPU
    works around a reported issue where SGX is "hard" disabled after an S3
    suspend/resume cycle, i.e. CPUID.0x7.SGX=0 and the VMCS field/control
    are enumerated as unsupported.  While the root cause of the S3 issue is
    unknown, it's definitely _not_ a KVM (or kernel) bug, i.e. this is a
    workaround for what is most likely a hardware or firmware issue.  As a
    bonus side effect, KVM saves a VMWRITE when first preparing vmcs01 and
    vmcs02.
    
    Note, SGX must be disabled in BIOS to take advantage of this workaround
    
    [*] The additional ENCLS CPUID check on SGX1 exists so that SGX can be
        globally "soft" disabled post-reset, e.g. if #MC bits in MCi_CTL are
        cleared.  Soft disabled meaning disabling SGX without clearing the
        primary CPUID bit (in leaf 0x7) and without poking into non-SGX
        CPU paths, e.g. for the VMCS controls.

    iommu/amd: Fix IOMMU AVIC not properly update the is_run bit in IRTE
    
    Commit b9c6ff94e43a ("iommu/amd: Re-factor guest virtual APIC
    (de-)activation code") accidentally left out the ir_data pointer when
    calling modity_irte_ga(), which causes the function amd_iommu_update_ga()
    to return prematurely due to struct amd_ir_data.ref is NULL and
    the "is_run" bit of IRTE does not get updated properly.
    
    This results in bad I/O performance since IOMMU AVIC always generate GA Log
    entry and notify IOMMU driver and KVM when it receives interrupt from the
    PCI pass-through device instead of directly inject interrupt to the vCPU.
    
    Fixes by passing ir_data when calling modify_irte_ga() as done previously.

    iommu/vt-d: Ignore devices with out-of-spec domain number
    
    VMD subdevices are created with a PCI domain ID of 0x10000 or
    higher.
    
    These subdevices are also handled like all other PCI devices by
    dmar_pci_bus_notifier().
    
    However, when dmar_alloc_pci_notify_info() take records of such devices,
    it will truncate the domain ID to a u16 value (in info->seg).
    The device at (e.g.) 10000:00:02.0 is then treated by the DMAR code as if
    it is 0000:00:02.0.
    
    In the unlucky event that a real device also exists at 0000:00:02.0 and
    also has a device-specific entry in the DMAR table,
    dmar_insert_dev_scope() will crash on:
       BUG_ON(i >= devices_cnt);
    
    That's basically a sanity check that only one PCI device matches a
    single DMAR entry; in this case we seem to have two matching devices.
    
    Fix this by ignoring devices that have a domain number higher than
    what can be looked up in the DMAR table.
    
    This problem was carefully diagnosed by Jian-Hong Pan.

    x86/vector: Remove warning on managed interrupt migration
    
    The vector management code assumes that managed interrupts cannot be
    migrated away from an online CPU. free_moved_vector() has a WARN_ON_ONCE()
    which triggers when a managed interrupt vector association on a online CPU
    is cleared. The CPU offline code uses a different mechanism which cannot
    trigger this.
    
    This assumption is not longer correct because the new CPU isolation feature
    which affects the placement of managed interrupts must be able to move a
    managed interrupt away from an online CPU.
    
    There are two reasons why this can happen:
    
      1) When the interrupt is activated the affinity mask which was
         established in irq_create_affinity_masks() is handed in to
         the vector allocation code. This mask contains all CPUs to which
         the interrupt can be made affine to, but this does not take the
         CPU isolation 'managed_irq' mask into account.
    
         When the interrupt is finally requested by the device driver then the
         affinity is checked again and the CPU isolation 'managed_irq' mask is
         taken into account, which moves the interrupt to a non-isolated CPU if
         possible.
    
      2) The interrupt can be affine to an isolated CPU because the
         non-isolated CPUs in the calculated affinity mask are not online.
    
         Once a non-isolated CPU which is in the mask comes online the
         interrupt is migrated to this non-isolated CPU
    
    In both cases the regular online migration mechanism is used which triggers
    the WARN_ON_ONCE() in free_moved_vector().
    
    Case #1 could have been addressed by taking the isolation mask into
    account, but that would require a massive code change in the activation
    logic and the eventual migration event was accepted as a reasonable
    tradeoff when the isolation feature was developed. But even if #1 would be
    addressed, #2 would still trigger it.
    
    Of course the warning in free_moved_vector() was overlooked at that time
    and the above two cases which have been discussed during patch review have
    obviously never been tested before the final submission.
    
    So keep it simple and remove the warning.

    drm/dp_mst: Rewrite and fix bandwidth limit checks
    
    Sigh, this is mostly my fault for not giving commit cd82d82cbc04
    ("drm/dp_mst: Add branch bandwidth validation to MST atomic check")
    enough scrutiny during review. The way we're checking bandwidth
    limitations here is mostly wrong:
    
    For starters, drm_dp_mst_atomic_check_bw_limit() determines the
    pbn_limit of a branch by simply scanning each port on the current branch
    device, then uses the last non-zero full_pbn value that it finds. It
    then counts the sum of the PBN used on each branch device for that
    level, and compares against the full_pbn value it found before.
    
    This is wrong because ports can and will have different PBN limitations
    on many hubs, especially since a number of DisplayPort hubs out there
    will be clever and only use the smallest link rate required for each
    downstream sink - potentially giving every port a different full_pbn
    value depending on what link rate it's trained at. This means with our
    current code, which max PBN value we end up with is not well defined.
    
    Additionally, we also need to remember when checking bandwidth
    limitations that the top-most device in any MST topology is a branch
    device, not a port. This means that the first level of a topology
    doesn't technically have a full_pbn value that needs to be checked.
    Instead, we should assume that so long as our VCPI allocations fit we're
    within the bandwidth limitations of the primary MSTB.
    
    We do however, want to check full_pbn on every port including those of
    the primary MSTB. However, it's important to keep in mind that this
    value represents the minimum link rate /between a port's sink or mstb,
    and the mstb itself/. A quick diagram to explain:
    
                                    MSTB #1
                                   /       \
                                  /         \
                               Port #1    Port #2
           full_pbn for Port #1 → |          | ← full_pbn for Port #2
                               Sink #1    MSTB #2
                                             |
                                           etc...
    
    Note that in the above diagram, the combined PBN from all VCPI
    allocations on said hub should not exceed the full_pbn value of port #2,
    and the display configuration on sink #1 should not exceed the full_pbn
    value of port #1. However, port #1 and port #2 can otherwise consume as
    much bandwidth as they want so long as their VCPI allocations still fit.
    
    And finally - our current bandwidth checking code also makes the mistake
    of not checking whether something is an end device or not before trying
    to traverse down it.
    
    So, let's fix it by rewriting our bandwidth checking helpers. We split
    the function into one part for handling branches which simply adds up
    the total PBN on each branch and returns it, and one for checking each
    port to ensure we're not going over its PBN limit. Phew.
    
    This should fix regressions seen, where we erroneously reject display
    configurations due to thinking they're going over our bandwidth limits
    when they're not.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Took an even closer look at how PBN limitations are supposed to be
      handled, and did some experimenting with Sean Paul. Ended up rewriting
      these helpers again, but this time they should actually be correct!
    Changes since v2:
    * Small indenting fix
    * Fix pbn_used check in drm_dp_mst_atomic_check_port_bw_limit()

    drm/dp_mst: Reprobe path resources in CSN handler
    
    We used to punt off reprobing path resources to the link address probe
    work, but now that we handle CSNs asynchronously from the driver's HPD
    handling we can do whatever the heck we want from the CSN!
    
    So, reprobe the path resources from drm_dp_mst_handle_conn_stat(). Also,
    get rid of the path resource reprobing code in
    drm_dp_check_and_send_link_address() since it's needlessly complicated
    when we already reprobe path resources from
    drm_dp_handle_link_address_port(). And finally, teach
    drm_dp_send_enum_path_resources() to return 1 on PBN changes so we know
    if we need to send another hotplug or not.
    
    This fixes issues where we've indicated to userspace that a port has
    just been connected, before we actually probed it's available PBN -
    something that results in unexpected atomic check failures.

    drm/dp_mst: Use full_pbn instead of available_pbn for bandwidth checks
    
    DisplayPort specifications are fun. For a while, it's been really
    unclear to us what available_pbn actually does. There's a somewhat vague
    explanation in the DisplayPort spec (starting from 1.2) that partially
    explains it:
    
      The minimum payload bandwidth number supported by the path. Each node
      updates this number with its available payload bandwidth number if its
      payload bandwidth number is less than that in the Message Transaction
      reply.
    
    So, it sounds like available_pbn represents the smallest link rate in
    use between the source and the branch device. Cool, so full_pbn is just
    the highest possible PBN that the branch device supports right?
    
    Well, we assumed that for quite a while until Sean Paul noticed that on
    some MST hubs, available_pbn will actually get set to 0 whenever there's
    any active payloads on the respective branch device. This caused quite a
    bit of confusion since clearing the payload ID table would end up fixing
    the available_pbn value.
    
    So, we just went with that until commit cd82d82cbc04 ("drm/dp_mst: Add
    branch bandwidth validation to MST atomic check") started breaking
    people's setups due to us getting erroneous available_pbn values. So, we
    did some more digging and got confused until we finally looked at the
    definition for full_pbn:
    
      The bandwidth of the link at the trained link rate and lane count
      between the DP Source device and the DP Sink device with no time slots
      allocated to VC Payloads, represented as a Payload Bandwidth Number. As
      with the Available_Payload_Bandwidth_Number, this number is determined
      by the link with the lowest lane count and link rate.
    
    That's what we get for not reading specs closely enough, hehe. So, since
    full_pbn is definitely what we want for doing bandwidth restriction
    checks - let's start using that instead and ignore available_pbn
    entirely.

    cifs_atomic_open(): fix double-put on late allocation failure
    
    several iterations of ->atomic_open() calling conventions ago, we
    used to need fput() if ->atomic_open() failed at some point after
    successful finish_open().  Now (since 2016) it's not needed -
    struct file carries enough state to make fput() work regardless
    of the point in struct file lifecycle and discarding it on
    failure exits in open() got unified.  Unfortunately, I'd missed
    the fact that we had an instance of ->atomic_open() (cifs one)
    that used to need that fput(), as well as the stale comment in
    finish_open() demanding such late failure handling.  Trivially
    fixed...

    taprio: Fix sending packets without dequeueing them
    
    There was a bug that was causing packets to be sent to the driver
    without first calling dequeue() on the "child" qdisc. And the KASAN
    report below shows that sending a packet without calling dequeue()
    leads to bad results.
    
    The problem is that when checking the last qdisc "child" we do not set
    the returned skb to NULL, which can cause it to be sent to the driver,
    and so after the skb is sent, it may be freed, and in some situations a
    reference to it may still be in the child qdisc, because it was never
    dequeued.
    
    The crash log looks like this:

    block: Fix partition support for host aware zoned block devices
    
    Commit b72053072c0b ("block: allow partitions on host aware zone
    devices") introduced the helper function disk_has_partitions() to check
    if a given disk has valid partitions. However, since this function result
    directly depends on the disk partition table length rather than the
    actual existence of valid partitions in the table, it returns true even
    after all partitions are removed from the disk. For host aware zoned
    block devices, this results in zone management support to be kept
    disabled even after removing all partitions.
    
    Fix this by changing disk_has_partitions() to walk through the partition
    table entries and return true if and only if a valid non-zero size
    partition is found.

    blk-mq: insert flush request to the front of dispatch queue
    
    commit 01e99aeca397 ("blk-mq: insert passthrough request into
    hctx->dispatch directly") may change to add flush request to the tail
    of dispatch by applying the 'add_head' parameter of
    blk_mq_sched_insert_request.
    
    Turns out this way causes performance regression on NCQ controller because
    flush is non-NCQ command, which can't be queued when there is any in-flight
    NCQ command. When adding flush rq to the front of hctx->dispatch, it is
    easier to introduce extra time to flush rq's latency compared with adding
    to the tail of dispatch queue because of S_SCHED_RESTART, then chance of
    flush merge is increased, and less flush requests may be issued to
    controller.
    
    So always insert flush request to the front of dispatch queue just like
    before applying commit 01e99aeca397 ("blk-mq: insert passthrough request
    into hctx->dispatch directly").

    s390/dasd: fix data corruption for thin provisioned devices
    
    Devices are formatted in multiple of tracks.
    For an Extent Space Efficient (ESE) volume we get errors when accessing
    unformatted tracks. In this case the driver either formats the track on
    the flight for write requests or returns zero data for read requests.
    
    In case a request spans multiple tracks, the indication of an unformatted
    track presented for the first track is incorrectly applied to all tracks
    covered by the request. As a result, tracks containing data will be handled
    as empty, resulting in zero data being returned on read, or overwriting
    existing data with zero on write.
    
    Fix by determining the track that gets the NRF error.
    For write requests only format the track that is surely not formatted.
    For Read requests all tracks before have returned valid data and should not
    be touched.
    All tracks after the unformatted track might be formatted or not. Those are
    returned to the blocklayer to build a new request.
    
    When using alias devices there is a chance that multiple write requests
    trigger a format of the same track which might lead to data loss. Ensure
    that a track is formatted only once by maintaining a list of currently
    processed tracks.

    misc: eeprom: at24: fix regulator underflow
    
    The at24 driver attempts to read a byte from the device to validate that
    it's actually present, and if not, disables the vcc regulator and
    returns -ENODEV. However, between the read and the error handling path,
    pm_runtime_idle() is called and invokes the driver's suspend callback,
    which also disables the vcc regulator. This leads to an underflow of the
    regulator enable count if the EEPROM is not present.
    
    Move the pm_runtime_suspend() call to be after the error handling path
    to resolve this.

    s390/qeth: implement smarter resizing of the RX buffer pool
    
    The RX buffer pool is allocated in qeth_alloc_qdio_queues().
    A subsequent pool resizing is then handled in a very simple way:
    first free the current pool, then allocate a new pool of the requested
    size.
    
    There's two ways where this can go wrong:
    1. if the resize action happens _before_ the initial pool was allocated,
       then a subsequent initialization will call qeth_alloc_qdio_queues()
       and fill the pool with a second(!) set of pages. We consume twice the
       planned amount of memory.
       This is easy to fix - just skip the resizing if the queues haven't
       been allocated yet.
    2. if the initial pool was created by qeth_alloc_qdio_queues() but a
       subsequent resizing fails, then the device has no(!) RX buffer pool.
       The next initialization will _not_ call qeth_alloc_qdio_queues(), and
       attempting to back the RX buffers with pages in
       qeth_init_qdio_queues() will fail.
       Not very difficult to fix either - instead of re-allocating the whole
       pool, just allocate/free as many entries to match the desired size.

    net: dsa: Don't instantiate phylink for CPU/DSA ports unless needed
    
    By default, DSA drivers should configure CPU and DSA ports to their
    maximum speed. In many configurations this is sufficient to make the
    link work.
    
    In some cases it is necessary to configure the link to run slower,
    e.g. because of limitations of the SoC it is connected to. Or back to
    back PHYs are used and the PHY needs to be driven in order to
    establish link. In this case, phylink is used.
    
    Only instantiate phylink if it is required. If there is no PHY, or no
    fixed link properties, phylink can upset a link which works in the
    default configuration.

    driver code: clarify and fix platform device DMA mask allocation
    
    This does three inter-related things to clarify the usage of the
    platform device dma_mask field. In the process, fix the bug introduced
    by cdfee5623290 ("driver core: initialize a default DMA mask for
    platform device") that caused Artem Tashkinov's laptop to not boot with
    newer Fedora kernels.
    
    This does:
    
     - First off, rename the field to "platform_dma_mask" to make it
       greppable.
    
       We have way too many different random fields called "dma_mask" in
       various data structures, where some of them are actual masks, and
       some of them are just pointers to the mask. And the structures all
       have pointers to each other, or embed each other inside themselves,
       and "pdev" sometimes means "platform device" and sometimes it means
       "PCI device".
    
       So to make it clear in the code when you actually use this new field,
       give it a unique name (it really should be something even more unique
       like "platform_device_dma_mask", since it's per platform device, not
       per platform, but that gets old really fast, and this is unique
       enough in context).
    
       To further clarify when the field gets used, initialize it when we
       actually start using it with the default value.
    
     - Then, use this field instead of the random one-off allocation in
       platform_device_register_full() that is now unnecessary since we now
       already have a perfectly fine allocation for it in the platform
       device structure.
    
     - The above then allows us to fix the actual bug, where the error path
       of platform_device_register_full() would unconditionally free the
       platform device DMA allocation with 'kfree()'.
    
       That kfree() was dont regardless of whether the allocation had been
       done earlier with the (now removed) kmalloc, or whether
       setup_pdev_dma_masks() had already been used and the dma_mask pointer
       pointed to the mask that was part of the platform device.
    
    It seems most people never triggered the error path, or only triggered
    it from a call chain that set an explicit pdevinfo->dma_mask value (and
    thus caused the unnecessary allocation that was "cleaned up" in the
    error path) before calling platform_device_register_full().
    
    Robin Murphy points out that in Artem's case the wdat_wdt driver failed
    in platform_device_add(), and that was the one that had called
    platform_device_register_full() with pdevinfo.dma_mask = 0, and would
    have caused that kfree() of pdev.dma_mask corrupting the heap.
    
    A later unrelated kmalloc() then oopsed due to the heap corruption.

    ftrace: Return the first found result in lookup_rec()
    
    It appears that ip ranges can overlap so. In that case lookup_rec()
    returns whatever results it got last even if it found nothing in last
    searched page.
    
    This breaks an obscure livepatch late module patching usecase:
      - load livepatch
      - load the patched module
      - unload livepatch
      - try to load livepatch again
    
    To fix this return from lookup_rec() as soon as it found the record
    containing searched-for ip. This used to be this way prior lookup_rec()
    introduction.

    s390/qeth: don't reset default_out_queue
    
    When an OSA device in prio-queue setup is reduced to 1 TX queue due to
    HW restrictions, we reset its the default_out_queue to 0.
    
    In the old code this was needed so that qeth_get_priority_queue() gets
    the queue selection right. But with proper multiqueue support we already
    reduced dev->real_num_tx_queues to 1, and so the stack puts all traffic
    on txq 0 without even calling .ndo_select_queue.
    
    Thus we can preserve the user's configuration, and apply it if the OSA
    device later re-gains support for multiple TX queues.

    ipv6/addrconf: call ipv6_mc_up() for non-Ethernet interface
    
    Rafał found an issue that for non-Ethernet interface, if we down and up
    frequently, the memory will be consumed slowly.
    
    The reason is we add allnodes/allrouters addressed in multicast list in
    ipv6_add_dev(). When link down, we call ipv6_mc_down(), store all multicast
    addresses via mld_add_delrec(). But when link up, we don't call ipv6_mc_up()
    for non-Ethernet interface to remove the addresses. This makes idev->mc_tomb
    getting bigger and bigger. The call stack looks like:
    
    addrconf_notify(NETDEV_REGISTER)
            ipv6_add_dev
                    ipv6_dev_mc_inc(ff01::1)
                    ipv6_dev_mc_inc(ff02::1)
                    ipv6_dev_mc_inc(ff02::2)
    
    addrconf_notify(NETDEV_UP)
            addrconf_dev_config
                    /* Alas, we support only Ethernet autoconfiguration. */
                    return;
    
    addrconf_notify(NETDEV_DOWN)
            addrconf_ifdown
                    ipv6_mc_down
                            igmp6_group_dropped(ff02::2)
                                    mld_add_delrec(ff02::2)
                            igmp6_group_dropped(ff02::1)
                            igmp6_group_dropped(ff01::1)
    
    After investigating, I can't found a rule to disable multicast on
    non-Ethernet interface. In RFC2460, the link could be Ethernet, PPP, ATM,
    tunnels, etc. In IPv4, it doesn't check the dev type when calls ip_mc_up()
    in inetdev_event(). Even for IPv6, we don't check the dev type and call
    ipv6_add_dev(), ipv6_dev_mc_inc() after register device.
    
    So I think it's OK to fix this memory consumer by calling ipv6_mc_up() for
    non-Ethernet interface.
    
    v2: Also check IFF_MULTICAST flag to make sure the interface supports
        multicast

    cgroup: memcg: net: do not associate sock with unrelated cgroup
    
    We are testing network memory accounting in our setup and noticed
    inconsistent network memory usage and often unrelated cgroups network
    usage correlates with testing workload. On further inspection, it
    seems like mem_cgroup_sk_alloc() and cgroup_sk_alloc() are broken in
    irq context specially for cgroup v1.
    
    mem_cgroup_sk_alloc() and cgroup_sk_alloc() can be called in irq context
    and kind of assumes that this can only happen from sk_clone_lock()
    and the source sock object has already associated cgroup. However in
    cgroup v1, where network memory accounting is opt-in, the source sock
    can be unassociated with any cgroup and the new cloned sock can get
    associated with unrelated interrupted cgroup.
    
    Cgroup v2 can also suffer if the source sock object was created by
    process in the root cgroup or if sk_alloc() is called in irq context.
    The fix is to just do nothing in interrupt.
    
    WARNING: Please note that about half of the TCP sockets are allocated
    from the IRQ context, so, memory used by such sockets will not be
    accouted by the memcg.

    workqueue: don't use wq_select_unbound_cpu() for bound works
    
    wq_select_unbound_cpu() is designed for unbound workqueues only, but
    it's wrongly called when using a bound workqueue too.
    
    Fixing this ensures work queued to a bound workqueue with
    cpu=WORK_CPU_UNBOUND always runs on the local CPU.
    
    Before, that would happen only if wq_unbound_cpumask happened to include
    it (likely almost always the case), or was empty, or we got lucky with
    forced round-robin placement.  So restricting
    /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask to a small subset of a machine's
    CPUs would cause some bound work items to run unexpectedly there.

    i2c: i801: Do not add ICH_RES_IO_SMI for the iTCO_wdt device
    
    Martin noticed that nct6775 driver does not load properly on his system
    in v5.4+ kernels. The issue was bisected to commit b84398d6d7f9 ("i2c:
    i801: Use iTCO version 6 in Cannon Lake PCH and beyond") but it is
    likely not the culprit because the faulty code has been in the driver
    already since commit 9424693035a5 ("i2c: i801: Create iTCO device on
    newer Intel PCHs"). So more likely some commit that added PCI IDs of
    recent chipsets made the driver to create the iTCO_wdt device on Martins
    system.
    
    The issue was debugged to be PCI configuration access to the PMC device
    that is not present. This returns all 1's when read and this caused the
    iTCO_wdt driver to accidentally request resourses used by nct6775.
    
    It turns out that the SMI resource is only required for some ancient
    systems, not the ones supported by this driver. For this reason do not
    populate the SMI resource at all and drop all the related code. The
    driver now always populates the main I/O resource and only in case of SPT
    (Intel Sunrisepoint) compatible devices it adds another resource for the
    NO_REBOOT bit. These two resources are of different types so
    platform_get_resource() used by the iTCO_wdt driver continues to find
    the both resources at index 0.

    net: mscc: ocelot: properly account for VLAN header length when setting MRU
    
    What the driver writes into MAC_MAXLEN_CFG does not actually represent
    VLAN_ETH_FRAME_LEN but instead ETH_FRAME_LEN + ETH_FCS_LEN. Yes they are
    numerically equal, but the difference is important, as the switch treats
    VLAN-tagged traffic specially and knows to increase the maximum accepted
    frame size automatically. So it is always wrong to account for VLAN in
    the MAC_MAXLEN_CFG register.
    
    Unconditionally increase the maximum allowed frame size for
    double-tagged traffic. Accounting for the additional length does not
    mean that the other VLAN membership checks aren't performed, so there's
    no harm done.
    
    Also, stop abusing the MTU name for configuring the MRU. There is no
    support for configuring the MRU on an interface at the moment.

    at a point we can reschedule

    macvlan: add cond_resched() during multicast processing
    
    The Rx bound multicast packets are deferred to a workqueue and
    macvlan can also suffer from the same attack that was discovered
    by Syzbot for IPvlan. This solution is not as effective as in
    IPvlan. IPvlan defers all (Tx and Rx) multicast packet processing
    to a workqueue while macvlan does this way only for the Rx. This
    fix should address the Rx codition to certain extent.
    
    Tx is still suseptible. Tx multicast processing happens when
    .ndo_start_xmit is called, hence we cannot add cond_resched().
    However, it's not that severe since the user which is generating
     / flooding will be affected the most.

    ipvlan: add cond_resched_rcu() while processing muticast backlog
    
    If there are substantial number of slaves created as simulated by
    Syzbot, the backlog processing could take much longer and result
    into the issue found in the Syzbot report.

    futex: Unbreak futex hashing
    
    The recent futex inode life time fix changed the ordering of the futex key
    union struct members, but forgot to adjust the hash function accordingly,
    
    As a result the hashing omits the leading 64bit and even hashes beyond the
    futex key causing a bad hash distribution which led to a ~100% performance
    regression.
    
    Hand in the futex key pointer instead of a random struct member and make
    the size calculation based of the struct offset.

    pinctrl: qcom: Assign irq_eoi conditionally
    
    The hierarchical parts of MSM pinctrl/GPIO is only
    used when the device tree has a "wakeup-parent" as
    a phandle, but the .irq_eoi is anyway assigned leading
    to semantic problems on elder Qualcomm chipsets.
    
    When the drivers/mfd/qcom-pm8xxx.c driver calls
    chained_irq_exit() that call will in turn call chip->irq_eoi()
    which is set to irq_chip_eoi_parent() by default on a
    hierachical IRQ chip, and the parent is pinctrl-msm.c
    so that will in turn unconditionally call
    irq_chip_eoi_parent() again, but its parent is invalid
    so we get the following crash:
    
     Unnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
     virtual address 00000010
     pgd = (ptrval)

     PC is at irq_chip_eoi_parent+0x4/0x10
     LR is at pm8xxx_irq_handler+0x1b4/0x2d8
    
    If we solve this crash by avoiding to call up to
    irq_chip_eoi_parent(), the machine will hang and get
    reset by the watchdog, because of semantic issues,
    probably inside irq_chip.
    
    As a solution, just assign the .irq_eoi conditionally if
    we are actually using a wakeup parent.

    In commit 1ec17dbd90f8 ("inet_diag: fix reporting cgroup classid and
    fallback to priority") croup classid reporting was fixed. But this works
    only for TCP sockets because for other socket types icsk parameter can
    be NULL and classid code path is skipped. This change moves classid
    handling to inet_diag_msg_attrs_fill() function.
    
    Also inet_diag_msg_attrs_size() helper was added and addends in
    nlmsg_new() were reordered to save order from inet_sk_diag_fill().

    net: stmmac: dwmac1000: Disable ACS if enhanced descs are not used
    
    ACS (auto PAD/FCS stripping) removes FCS off 802.3 packets (LLC) so that
    there is no need to manually strip it for such packets. The enhanced DMA
    descriptors allow to flag LLC packets so that the receiving callback can
    use that to strip FCS manually or not. On the other hand, normal
    descriptors do not support that.
    
    Thus in order to not truncate LLC packet ACS should be disabled when

    gre: fix uninit-value in __iptunnel_pull_header
    
    syzbot found an interesting case of the kernel reading
    an uninit-value [1]
    
    Problem is in the handling of ETH_P_WCCP in gre_parse_header()
    
    We look at the byte following GRE options to eventually decide
    if the options are four bytes longer.
    
    Use skb_header_pointer() to not pull bytes if we found
    that no more bytes were needed.
    
    All callers of gre_parse_header() are properly using pskb_may_pull()
    anyway before proceeding to next header.

    ipvlan: do not add hardware address of master to its unicast filter list
    
    There is a problem when ipvlan slaves are created on a master device that
    is a vmxnet3 device (ipvlan in VMware guests). The vmxnet3 driver does not
    support unicast address filtering. When an ipvlan device is brought up in
    ipvlan_open(), the ipvlan driver calls dev_uc_add() to add the hardware
    address of the vmxnet3 master device to the unicast address list of the
    master device, phy_dev->uc. This inevitably leads to the vmxnet3 master
    device being forced into promiscuous mode by __dev_set_rx_mode().
    
    Promiscuous mode is switched on the master despite the fact that there is
    still only one hardware address that the master device should use for
    filtering in order for the ipvlan device to be able to receive packets.
    The comment above struct net_device describes the uc_promisc member as a
    "counter, that indicates, that promiscuous mode has been enabled due to
    the need to listen to additional unicast addresses in a device that does
    not implement ndo_set_rx_mode()". Moreover, the design of ipvlan
    guarantees that only the hardware address of a master device,
    phy_dev->dev_addr, will be used to transmit and receive all packets from
    its ipvlan slaves. Thus, the unicast address list of the master device
    should not be modified by ipvlan_open() and ipvlan_stop() in order to make
    ipvlan a workable option on masters that do not support unicast address
    filtering.

    io_uring: ensure RCU callback ordering with rcu_barrier()
    
    After more careful studying, Paul informs me that we cannot rely on
    ordering of RCU callbacks in the way that the the tagged commit did.
    The current construct looks like this:
    
            void C(struct rcu_head *rhp)
            {
                    do_something(rhp);
                    call_rcu(&p->rh, B);
            }
    
            call_rcu(&p->rh, A);
            call_rcu(&p->rh, C);
    
    and we're relying on ordering between A and B, which isn't guaranteed.
    Make this explicit instead, and have a work item issue the rcu_barrier()
    to ensure that A has run before we manually execute B.
    
    While thorough testing never showed this issue, it's dependent on the
    per-cpu load in terms of RCU callbacks. The updated method simplifies
    the code as well, and eliminates the need to maintain an rcu_head in
    the fileset data.

    pid: Fix error return value in some cases
    
    Recent changes to alloc_pid() allow the pid number to be specified on
    the command line.  If set_tid_size is set, then the code scanning the
    levels will hard-set retval to -EPERM, overriding it's previous -ENOMEM
    value.
    
    After the code scanning the levels, there are error returns that do not
    set retval, assuming it is still set to -ENOMEM.
    
    So set retval back to -ENOMEM after scanning the levels.

    virtio-blk: fix hw_queue stopped on arbitrary error
    
    Since nobody else is going to restart our hw_queue for us, the
    blk_mq_start_stopped_hw_queues() is in virtblk_done() is not sufficient
    necessarily sufficient to ensure that the queue will get started again.
    In case of global resource outage (-ENOMEM because mapping failure,
    because of swiotlb full) our virtqueue may be empty and we can get
    stuck with a stopped hw_queue.
    
    Let us not stop the queue on arbitrary errors, but only on -EONSPC which
    indicates a full virtqueue, where the hw_queue is guaranteed to get
    started by virtblk_done() before when it makes sense to carry on
    submitting requests. Let us also remove a stale comment.

    virtio_ring: Fix mem leak with vring_new_virtqueue()
    
    The functions vring_new_virtqueue() and __vring_new_virtqueue() are used
    with split rings, and any allocations within these functions are managed
    outside of the .we_own_ring flag. The commit cbeedb72b97a ("virtio_ring:
    allocate desc state for split ring separately") allocates the desc state
    within the __vring_new_virtqueue() but frees it only when the .we_own_ring
    flag is set. This leads to a memory leak when freeing such allocated
    virtqueues with the vring_del_virtqueue() function.
    
    Fix this by moving the desc_state free code outside the flag and only
    for split rings. Issue was discovered during testing with remoteproc
    and virtio_rpmsg.

    efi: Fix a race and a buffer overflow while reading efivars via sysfs
    
    There is a race and a buffer overflow corrupting a kernel memory while
    reading an EFI variable with a size more than 1024 bytes via the older
    sysfs method. This happens because accessing struct efi_variable in
    efivar_{attr,size,data}_read() and friends is not protected from
    a concurrent access leading to a kernel memory corruption and, at best,
    to a crash. The race scenario is the following:
    
    CPU0:                                CPU1:
    efivar_attr_read()
      var->DataSize = 1024;
      efivar_entry_get(... &var->DataSize)
        down_interruptible(&efivars_lock)
                                         efivar_attr_read() // same EFI var
                                           var->DataSize = 1024;
                                           efivar_entry_get(... &var->DataSize)
                                             down_interruptible(&efivars_lock)
        virt_efi_get_variable()
        // returns EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL but
        // var->DataSize is set to a real
        // var size more than 1024 bytes
        up(&efivars_lock)
                                             virt_efi_get_variable()
                                             // called with var->DataSize set
                                             // to a real var size, returns
                                             // successfully and overwrites
                                             // a 1024-bytes kernel buffer
                                             up(&efivars_lock)
    
    This can be reproduced by concurrent reading of an EFI variable which size
    is more than 1024 bytes:
    
      ts# for cpu in $(seq 0 $(nproc --ignore=1)); do ( taskset -c $cpu \
      cat /sys/firmware/efi/vars/KEKDefault*/size & ) ; done
    
    Fix this by using a local variable for a var's data buffer size so it
    does not get overwritten.

    fscrypt: don't evict dirty inodes after removing key
    
    After FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY removes a key, it syncs the
    filesystem and tries to get and put all inodes that were unlocked by the
    key so that unused inodes get evicted via fscrypt_drop_inode().
    Normally, the inodes are all clean due to the sync.
    
    However, after the filesystem is sync'ed, userspace can modify and close
    one of the files.  (Userspace is *supposed* to close the files before
    removing the key.  But it doesn't always happen, and the kernel can't
    assume it.)  This causes the inode to be dirtied and have i_count == 0.
    Then, fscrypt_drop_inode() failed to consider this case and indicated
    that the inode can be dropped, causing the write to be lost.
    
    On f2fs, other problems such as a filesystem freeze could occur due to
    the inode being freed while still on f2fs's dirty inode list.
    
    Fix this bug by making fscrypt_drop_inode() only drop clean inodes.

    bonding/alb: make sure arp header is pulled before accessing it
    
    Similar to commit 38f88c454042 ("bonding/alb: properly access headers
    in bond_alb_xmit()"), we need to make sure arp header was pulled
    in skb->head before blindly accessing it in rlb_arp_xmit().
    
    Remove arp_pkt() private helper, since it is more readable/obvious
    to have the following construct back to back :
    
            if (!pskb_network_may_pull(skb, sizeof(*arp)))
                    return NULL;
            arp = (struct arp_pkt *)skb_network_header(skb);

      };
    
      #define TIOCL_SETSEL    2
      struct tiocl {
        unsigned char type;
        unsigned char pad;
        struct tiocl_selection sel;
      };
    
      int main()
      {
        int fd = 0;
        const char *dev = "/dev/char/4:1";
    
        struct vt_consize v = {0};
        struct tiocl tioc = {0};
    
        fd = open(dev, O_RDWR, 0);
    
        v.v_rows = 3346;
        ioctl(fd, VT_RESIZEX, &v);
    
        tioc.type = TIOCL_SETSEL;
        ioctl(fd, TIOCLINUX, &tioc);
    
        return 0;
      }
    
    When resize the screen, update the 'vc->vc_size_row' to the new_row_size,
    but when 'set_origin' in 'vgacon_set_origin', vgacon use 'vga_vram_base'
    for 'vc_origin' and 'vc_visible_origin', not 'vc_screenbuf'. It maybe
    smaller than 'vc_screenbuf'. When TIOCLINUX, use the new_row_size to calc
    the offset, it maybe larger than the vga_vram_size in vgacon driver, then
    bad access.
    Also, if set an larger screenbuf firstly, then set an more larger
    screenbuf, when copy old_origin to new_origin, a bad access may happen.
    
    So, If the screen size larger than vga_vram, resize screen should be
    failed. This alse fix CVE-2020-8649 and CVE-2020-8647.
    
    Linus pointed out that overflow checking seems absent. We're saved by
    the existing bounds checks in vc_do_resize() with rather strict
    limits:
    
            if (cols > VC_RESIZE_MAXCOL || lines > VC_RESIZE_MAXROW)
                    return -EINVAL;

    dt-bindings: arm: Fixup the DT bindings for hierarchical PSCI states
    
    The hierarchical topology with power-domain should be described through
    child nodes, rather than as currently described in the PSCI root node. Fix
    this by adding a patternProperties with a corresponding reference to the
    power-domain DT binding.
    
    Additionally, update the example to conform to the new pattern, but also to
    the adjusted domain-idle-state DT binding.

    locks: fix a potential use-after-free problem when wakeup a waiter
    
    '16306a61d3b7 ("fs/locks: always delete_block after waiting.")' add the
    logic to check waiter->fl_blocker without blocked_lock_lock. And it will
    trigger a UAF when we try to wakeup some waiter：
    
    Thread 1 has create a write flock a on file, and now thread 2 try to
    unlock and delete flock a, thread 3 try to add flock b on the same file.
    
    Thread2                         Thread3
                                    flock syscall(create flock b)
                                    ...flock_lock_inode_wait
                                        flock_lock_inode(will insert
                                        our fl_blocked_member list
                                        to flock a's fl_blocked_requests)
                                       sleep
    flock syscall(unlock)

        ...__locks_wake_up_blocks
            __locks_delete_blocks(
            b->fl_blocker = NULL)
            ...
                                       break by a signal
                                       locks_delete_block
                                        b->fl_blocker == NULL &&
                                        list_empty(&b->fl_blocked_requests)
                                        success, return directly
                                     locks_free_lock b
            wake_up(&b->fl_waiter)
            trigger UAF
    
    Fix it by remove this logic, and this patch may also fix CVE-2019-19769.

    tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: free IDs allocated by IDA
    
    Since commit 3bc3206e1c0f ("serial: fsl_lpuart: Remove the alias node
    dependence") the port line number can also be allocated by IDA, but in
    case of an error the ID will no be removed again. More importantly, any
    ID will be freed in remove(), even if it wasn't allocated but instead
    fetched by of_alias_get_id(). If it was not allocated by IDA there will
    be a warning:
      WARN(1, "ida_free called for id=%d which is not allocated.\n", id);
    
    Move the ID allocation more to the end of the probe() so that we still
    can use plain return in the first error cases.

    Revert "tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: drop EARLYCON_DECLARE"
    
    This reverts commit a659652f6169240a5818cb244b280c5a362ef5a4.
    
    This broke the earlycon on LS1021A processors because the order of the
    earlycon_setup() functions were changed. Before the commit the normal
    lpuart32_early_console_setup() was called. After the commit the
    lpuart32_imx_early_console_setup() is called instead.

    serdev: Fix detection of UART devices on Apple machines.
    
    On Apple devices the _CRS method returns an empty resource template, and
    the resource settings are instead provided by the _DSM method. But
    commit 33364d63c75d6182fa369cea80315cf1bb0ee38e (serdev: Add ACPI
    devices by ResourceSource field) changed the search for serdev devices
    to require valid, non-empty resource template, thereby breaking Apple
    devices and causing bluetooth devices to not be found.
    
    This expands the check so that if we don't find a valid template, and
    we're on an Apple machine, then just check for the device being an
    immediate child of the controller and having a "baud" property.
